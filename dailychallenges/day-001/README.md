**Date:** 2025-09-25  
**Theme:** Machine Learning / Regression  
**Goal:** Understand and implement a simple linear regression to predict total bill based on the number of items purchased.

## 1️⃣ Concept

**Linear Regression:**  
- Predict the dependent variable `y` using the independent variable `x`.  
- Formula:  
\[
y = m*x + c
\]  
  - `y` → predicted value (total prices)  
  - `x` → independent value (quantity of items)  
  - `m` → slope (how y changes with x)  
  - `c` → intercept (value of y when x=0)  

**Shopping Analogy:**  
- Independent (`x`) → Number of shirts bought  
- Dependent (`y`) → Total bill amount  
- Example:  
  - 1 shirt  = ₹100  
  - 2 shirts = ₹150 (bundle discount)  
  - 3 shirts = ₹200
  - 4 shirts = ₹250
  - 5 shirts = ₹300
- Predicting for 5 shirts → linear regression provides approximate total bill.
